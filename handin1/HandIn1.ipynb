    "### Implementing Logistic Regression\n",
    "In this exercise you must implement logistic regression and test it on text classification.\n",
    "We have provided starter code in the file **logistic_regression.py**. \n",
    "Here you should complete the following methods to implement a Logistic Regression Classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "* logistic \n",
    "* predict \n",
    "* score\n",
    "* cost_grad\n",
    "* fit\n",
    "\n",
    "where *predict, score, cost_grad, fit* are class methods of the classifier you must implement.\n",
    "The interface for each function is described in the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "All needed equations can be found in the slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can test your implementation by running *python logistic_regression.py*. \n",
    "This is a small non-exhaustive test. You should consider writing your own test cases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Cost and gradient computations sometimes suffers from numerical issues if we are not careful. Exponentation of large numbers and log of small numbers can lead to numerical issues. It is possible to implement the algorithm to be more numerically stable if you do not compute numbers you do not need. The algorithm should work well enough even if you are not so careful and it is not a requirement for passing the hand in to make the ultimate numerically stable algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying Logistic Regression \n",
    "You will test your implementation on a real-life data set obtained from the danish central business register (CVR). The data set consists of text descriptions of the purpose of a company, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Selskabets form√•l er at drive restaurant og dertil knyttet virksomhed.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "together with a label indicating the so-called industry code, e.g. 561010 is the code for \"Restauranter\" and 620100 is the code for \"Computerprogrammering\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already written code that transforms a text description into a feature vector, so you do not need to worry about this translation. We will see later in the course how to do so. In this exercise, you will train a logistic regression classifier to classify descriptions of company purposes into the two classes \"Restauranter\" and \"Computerprogrammering\". If you want to have a look at the data, you can unzip \"branchekoder_formal.gzip\" and open it as a text file (keep the .gzip file in the directory). We are only extracting companies falling in the two categories 561010 and 620100.\n",

    "Furthermore you must answer the following three theoretical questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the running time of your mini-batch gradient descent algorithm?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The parameters:\n",
    "  * **n**: number of training samples\n",
    "  * **d**: dimensionality of training samples\n",
    "  * **epochs**: number of epochs run\n",
    "  * **mini_batch_size**: batch_size for mini_batch_gradient_descent\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Write both the time to compute the cost and the gradient for log_cost\n",
    "  You can assume that multiplying an $a \\times b$ matrix with a $b \\times c$ matrix takes $O(abc)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sanity Check:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you are using Logistic Regression for classifying images of cats and dogs.\n",
    "What happens if we randomly permute the pixels in each image (with the same permutation) before we train the classifier? Will we get a classifier that is better, worse, or the same than if we used the raw data? Give a short explanation (at most three sentences). \n",
    "  HINT: The location of pixels relative to each other seem to hold some kind of information. Does a random permutation of all pixels position affect this locality? Does the model we use exploit pixel locality? \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Linearly Separable Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data is linearly separable, what happens\n",
    "to weights when we implement logistic regression with gradient\n",
    "descent? That is, how do the weights that minimize the negative log likelihood look like?\n",
    "You may assume that we have full precision (that is, ignore floating point errors) and we can run gradient descent as long as we want (i.e. what happens with the weights in the limit). \n",
    "\n",
    "Give a short explanation for your answer. You may include math if it helps (at most 5 lines).\n"

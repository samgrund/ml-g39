    "# Neural Nets for Multiclass Classification\n",
    "In this exercise you must implement a multi-class classifier based on neural nets.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must implement a one hidden layer neural net with relu activation function for the hidden layer and $K$ outputs that are not transformed (i.e.) the output neurons compute the identity function.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the loss function, the $K$ outputs of the neural net are transformed by softmax and the loss is mean negative log likelihood (special case of cross entropy loss, and it is the same loss as considered in Hand In 1) and is explained in the next cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "For combatting overfitting you must implement weight decay and use validation to output the best model parameters seen during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "With weight decay the cost of one data point becomes becomes\n",

    "$$\n",

    "where $y$ is the one-in-k encoding of the data point label (one entry with a one, the rest are zero), nn(x) is the output of the neural net on data point $x$, $\\textrm{softmax}(\\textrm{nn}(x))_i$ is the $i$'th entry in the vector of *probabilities* computed by softmax, and $W_1$, and $W_2$ are the weight matrices for the neural net. Note that biases are not part of the weight decay term.\n",
    "\n",
    "For validation, you must evaluate the accuracy on a validation set after each epoch (note this does not include the weight decay term or the nll term, only accuracy). The final returned model must be the one obtaining the best validation accuracy.\n",

    "As discussed in lectures, a nice way to understand backpropagation is given  [here](http://cs231n.github.io/optimization-2/).\n",
    "Everything can be coded in a vectorized way using matrices and vectors and their products. But this is **not** required.\n",
    "For example, it is fine to implement the derivative computation assuming just one input point, and then repeating that computation for each input data point in the mini-batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test in net_classifier.py tests the gradient of your cost using a numerical estimate of the gradient of the cost for every parameter.\n",
